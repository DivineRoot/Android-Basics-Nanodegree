    <string name="info_city_name">About the 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝘾𝙄𝙏𝙔 𝙊𝙁 𝙅𝙊𝙔</string>
    <string name="info_city_description">The second biggest city of the country, Kolkata was formerly called as 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗰𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗮.
        Being the 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝗥𝗮𝗷, Kolkata is a city that holds an extremely crucial place in the economy,
        politics and culture of India. Being the 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗪𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗹, Kolkata is also known as the 𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮.
        With a quintessential charm that it has retained apart from just the modernization, Kolkata is amongst the
        four metropolitan cities of India. With a dense heritage, Kolkata is densely populated and is situated at the
        banks of river Ganga. Being famous for its culture, Kolkata is known for its people, food, music, literature
        and movies as well. Being the home of few major and great thinkers, artists, film makes and writers, Kolkata is
        associated with 𝗥𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗧𝗮𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗲, 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗺 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗽𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗮𝘆𝗮𝘆, 𝗦𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗽𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗮𝘆𝗮𝘆 and 𝗦𝙖𝘁𝗮𝘆𝗷𝗶𝘁 𝗥𝗼𝘆.
        No wonder, Kolkata is indeed an inspiration for the country in the field of art literature and theater.
        Considered as if Bangalore is the Seattle of India then Kolkata is the sub continent\’s London. The \‘in your face\’
        city that leaves every single visitor in shock with its charm, abject poverty inexplicably with crumbling the gems of
        British Raj era, sprawling gardens and historical colleges. Kolkata is a city one can hate or love but will never forget
        in his lifetime.</string>
    <string name="info_helpful_tips">Helpful Tips!</string>
